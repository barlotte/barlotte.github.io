			<h1 class="article-title">My Coding Journey: A Holistic Approach to Understanding Tech</h1>
			<section class="article-content">
				<p>In my journey to understand coding, I set out with a practical goal – to enhance my role as a Product Manager. Coming from a background in translation and interpretation, I noticed a straightforward connection in the way coding languages and human languages are structured, and it got me curious.</p>
				<p>As I knew it would take time in gaining a proper understanding, I dedicated a few months to explore various programming languages and have an holistic approach of development (coding for data management, applications, website design and interactions…). My aim was to expand my skill set and improve communication with my tech peers, understanding their daily challenges and pains but also discover what excites them so much about coding.</p>
				<p>After wrapping up my time at <a href="../pages/sybel.html">Sybel</a> I decided to spice things up a bit. I enrolled in a month-long coding bootcamp at 42 school, diving into the fundamentals of C programming and shell basics. Beyond coding, it was a fantastic opportunity to connect with new people, and put to the test my algorithmic thinking — a skill I'd maintained in the background during a decade of human science studies in literature, languages, and management. This immersive experience not only showcased the elegance of the C language but also solidified my belief: I genuinely enjoy coding, and I'm eager to deepen my knowledge.</p>
				<p>After 42, I shifted my focus to Python due to its versatility and proximity to C. Starting with Python for data through tutorials and practical experiments on open datasets. Transitioning to Python for applications, I aimed to grasp how things work within an app, including the creation of views and communication with databases... As I concluded this first learning phase, I felt the need to culminate it with a personal project —the website you are currently exploring. Designed on figma and crafted with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS, this evolutive project equipped me with the fundamentals to independently bring future creative ideas to life.</p>
				<p>The 42 school experience, combined with independent explorations, offered me valuable insights on the coding world. I gained a better understanding of the real impact of interruptions on developers' concentration, the complexe balance between the perpetual pursuit of perfection and necessity to ship fast and clean, and the challenges of managing technical debt. These insights have broadened my perspective and allowed me to empathize more with the challenges faced by my tech peers.</p>
				<p>As I transition back to my role in Product Management, I carry these newfound skills with me. My future endeavors involve further exploration of JavaScript, investigating 3D libraries like Babylon or Three.js, and understanding mobile app development through Swift. This journey, grounded in a practical approach, underlined the belief that coding is not just a skill but a down-to-earth lens through which one can navigate and contribute to the expansive landscape of technology.</p>
